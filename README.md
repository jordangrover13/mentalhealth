From it's website, "MH-CLD and the Mental Health Treatment Episode Data Set (MH-TEDS) provide information on mental health diagnoses and the mental health treatment services, outcomes, and demographic and substance use characteristics of people in mental health treatment facilities. This information comes from facilities that report to individual state administrative data systems."

The Codebook is included. 

This .Rmd file attempts to use this dataset to estimate a model that predicts substance use, knowing a client's demographic profile and mental health diagnosis. This type of prediction could be used in screening patients for further questioning about the possibilty of substance use in order to prevent providers from missing this diagnosis.
